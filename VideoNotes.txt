-How the hoverboard works
-Prototype level

-First level layout
-Waypoint system
-Rotation problems
-Prop placement issues
-Level bounds collision issues
-Character slow down on start (Bug)
-Changes to the board system
	-Always up rotation while grounded
	-Doesn't bend with the level anymore
	-Board physics and character model are separate, allowing for the rotations (tricks)

-Second level layout
-A single waypoint
-Easier placement of props
-Boundry collision isses fixed
-Less interesting of a level

-Third level is a cutscene
-Different player script
	-Moves and rotates towards waypoints with no physics at all
-Bezier curve is placed on top of the rail
-Converting the bezier curve to a series of waypoints
	-Exporting the points to a CSV file
	-Putting that file in the Resources folder and loading it as a text file
	-Remove the non-convertable characters and split the data
	-float.Parse the data into a Vector3, and swap the Y and Z axis
